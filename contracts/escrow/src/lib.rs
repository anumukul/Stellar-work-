    // "Contract upgrades are untested, risking data loss on deployment."
    //
    // A Soroban upgrade replaces the contract's *code* while leaving the
    // contract's *storage* untouched. These tests simulate that in two ways:
    //
    //  1. Re-registering a second implementation (`EscrowContractV2`) at the
    //     SAME address — the test host's way of swapping compiled-in code in
    //     place while preserving storage. This exercises the v1 → v2 migration
    //     scenario (schema-version stamp, idempotent `migrate`) and rollback.
    //  2. Driving the real `propose_upgrade` → `execute_upgrade` path, which
    //     ends in `update_current_contract_wasm` with an uploaded WASM hash,
    //     and asserting data survives.
    //
    // `EscrowContractV2` shares v1's exact storage layout (the same `DataKey`/
    // `ExtKey` keys) and adds new keys of its own — the standard upgrade shape.
